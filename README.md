# Jarvis A.I - Voice Controlled AI Assistant

## Project Overview

Jarvis A.I is a command-line based personal AI assistant designed to run on Chrome OS Flex. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini API for natural language processing and AI-related tasks, allowing for interactive chat and prompt-based AI generation. This project is built using Python and incorporates the `speech_recognition` library for voice input, allowing for hands-free interaction. The assistant uses `espeak` for text-to-speech output, making it a fully functional voice-driven tool.

## Key Features

*   **Voice-Activated Interaction:** Uses the `speech_recognition` library to process voice commands, allowing for seamless hands-free control.
*   **Gemini API Integration:** Employs the Google Gemini API for both conversational chat and general AI prompt processing, providing powerful language capabilities.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Uses the command line, and can run on your terminal.
*   **Text-to-Speech Output:** Provides audio feedback using the `espeak` text-to-speech engine, making the interactions more conversational.
*   **Web Browsing Control:** Supports basic web browsing commands, such as opening specified websites.
*   **Music Playback:** Enables playing local music files through voice commands.
*  **Basic AI Prompt Interaction:** Has the ability to use Gemini's AI by simply saying 'using artificial intelligence'.
*   **Optimized for Chrome OS Flex:** Developed and tested to run effectively on Chrome OS Flex, a lightweight and flexible operating system.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Jarvis A.I, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

*   **Python 3.7+:** This project is built using Python, so you need a suitable installation.
*   **pip:** The Python package installer.
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio.
*   **Required Python Libraries:**
    *   `speechrecognition`
    *   `google-generativeai`
    *   `numpy`
    *   `pyaudio`
*   **espeak:** A text-to-speech engine for Linux systems.

Configuration

Set Google Gemini API Key: You must set the Google Gemini API Key by setting the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY. Otherwise replace the YOUR_API_KEY_HERE text with your key directly in the main.py file.

Get Microphone Index:

Run arecord -l in your terminal to list your audio devices.

Note the device information and test that device using arecord -d 5 test.wav -D <device id>.

If aplay test.wav works set the microphone_device_index with that device.

Set the microphone_device_index variable in main.py to the appropriate device ID you want to use.

Set the PA_ALSA_PLUGHW variable: The code will set the PA_ALSA_PLUGHW variable, but if there are any issues you can also set this manually with export PA_ALSA_PLUGHW=1

How to Run

Make main.py executable:

chmod +x main.py
content_copy
download

Bash

Run the script:

python3 main.py

Example Usage

Open a website: "Open youtube"

Ask for the current time: "What is the time"

Start a chat: "hello how are you"

Use AI generation: "Using artificial intelligence, generate a short story about cats"

Troubleshooting

If you run into audio issues:

Run python3 main.py and note the output of the pyaudio device listing.

Use arecord to test the device.

Set the microphone_device_index variable correctly.

Make sure you have pyaudio and espeak installed correctly.
